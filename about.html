<p>Hello, everyone! My name is Nina Bahmani, and I'm a Kurdish coder and founder of Two2Parent I enjoy baking, scrapbooking, 
    coding my own personal website, and petting my two kitties, Dolly and Putin! My goal is to make Two2Parent a phonomenal resource
    to those who need it!</p>

<h1> Two2Parent's Purpose </h1>
